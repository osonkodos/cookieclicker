# cookieclicker
Selenium webdriver based script that plays the game on it's own.

Cookie clicker is a web browser based game where the player has to click on the cookie to gather cookies. Later, the player my buy upgrades from the gathered cookies. The aim of this project was to get to work with the Selenium webdriver. While the script is running, it keeps on clicking on the cookie, gathering cookies this way. Also, periodically it checks wether there are any available upgrades. If there is something it can buy, it will buy it, to make it even more efficient. The script runs for a given amount of time and logs the cookie/per minute as a measurement.
